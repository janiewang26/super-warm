## Super Warm

Super Warm is what we envision to be an online mental health forum, specifically, for university students. The platform allows for anonymous postings, online live chat with verified consultants and students, as well as appointment scheduling.

## Inspiration

Going into my third year of university, I was struggling with some severe anxiety issues dealing with the workload from school and financial stress that came with coming to university. Left alone with no professional help for the years prior, it wasn't till I met my teammate, Janie, who was already registered with the Centre for Accessibility on campus, who helped me navigate through the system and helped get myself registered so that my mental health could be better supported in the hands of professionals.

If it weren't for Janie, I probably would never have known how to navigate through mental health resources on campus. Albeit, the pamphlets and resources are out there and everywhere, but it all felt intimidating and crowded. I simply didn't know where to get started. Having a friend to ease me through the process made it all the more comfortable - I didn't feel judged, just supported. More importantly, I didn't need to book an appointment with a professional, which usually requires weeks of waiting before the next available appointment.

Super Warm as an idea brought to light when I realized that anonymous posting feature was already available on a classroom forum called Piazza. I wanted to provide that sense of anonymity and security so that anyone would be able to ask anything regarding mental health and anyone who is already in the system, or is a mental health practitioner or consultant would be able to answer it.
